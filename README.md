Home Range Analyses for Free-Ranging Maremma Sheepdogs

https://jfbrumley.github.io/Home-On-The-Range/

Data from van Bommel and Johnson 2014

They studied the movement of these sheepdogs that are used in Australia as livestock guarding dogs.
I specifically looked at the movement of two dogs: Ringo and Rosie.
I used the GPS tracked movement data to create a "home range" for these two sheepdogs.
